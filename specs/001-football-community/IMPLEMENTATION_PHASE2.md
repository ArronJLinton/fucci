## Files Created/Modified

### Database Migrations

- `services/api/sql/schema/012_create_matches.sql` - Match table schema
- `services/api/sql/schema/014_create_user_follows.sql` - UserFollows table schema
- `services/api/sql/schema/015_create_indexes.sql` - Database indexes
- `services/api/sql/schema/016_add_auth_to_users.sql` - User authentication fields

### Authentication Module

- `services/api/internal/auth/jwt.go` - JWT token generation and validation
- `services/api/internal/auth/password.go` - Password hashing utilities

### API Endpoints

- `services/api/internal/api/auth.go` - Login, profile management endpoints
- `services/api/internal/api/users.go` - Updated registration with password hashing
- `services/api/internal/api/api.go` - Updated routes with auth middleware

## Required Dependencies

Add these dependencies to `services/api/go.mod`:

```bash
go get github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v5
go get golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt
```

## Environment Variables

Add to `.env` file:

```
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-here-change-in-production
```

## API Endpoints

### Authentication Routes (No auth required)

- `POST /api/auth/register` - Register new user
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Login user

### User Routes (Auth required)

- `GET /api/users/profile` - Get current user profile
- `PUT /api/users/profile` - Update current user profile

### Protected Routes

The following routes now require authentication via JWT token in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header:

- All `/api/users/*` routes (except profile endpoints)
- `/api/teams` management endpoints
- `/api/team-managers` endpoints
- `/api/player-profiles` endpoints
- Other protected resources

## Features Implemented

### Password Security

- Password hashing using bcrypt
- Password strength validation (minimum 8 characters)
- Password verification on login

### JWT Authentication

- Token generation with user ID, email, and role
- Token validation middleware
- Token expiration (24 hours default)
- Secure token signing with HS256

### Role-Based Access Control

- User roles: `fan`, `team_manager`, `admin`
- Middleware for role-based route protection
- Context-based user information extraction

### User Profile Management

- Get current user profile
- Update profile fields (firstname, lastname, display_name, avatar_url)
- Last login tracking

## Next Steps

1. Run database migrations:

   ```bash
   cd services/api
   go run cmd/migrate/main.go
   ```

2. Dependencies have been added to go.mod:

   - `github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v5 v5.3.0`
   - `golang.org/x/crypto v0.21.0`

   Go toolchain updated to 1.24.0.

3. Set environment variable `JWT_SECRET` in `.env` file

4. Test authentication flow:
   - Register a new user at `POST /api/auth/register`
   - Login at `POST /api/auth/login` to get JWT token
   - Use token in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header for protected routes

## Summary

All Phase 2 foundational tasks have been completed successfully. The authentication system is now in place with:

- Secure password hashing and verification
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- User profile management
- Database models for matches and user follows
- Performance indexes for all tables

The API is now ready for the next phase of development.
