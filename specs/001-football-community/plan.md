# Implementation Plan: Football Community Platform

**Branch**: `001-football-community` | **Date**: 2025-01-23 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-football-community/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Build a global fan and grassroots football community platform combining live match insights, AI-powered debates, and media-driven engagement. The platform will serve as a mobile application for football fans and community teams, merging real-time match engagement (like FotMob) with social and interactive features (like Reddit, Snapchat, and Instagram Stories).

**Technical Approach**: React Native mobile app with Go backend, PostgreSQL database, Redis caching, and AI integration for debate generation. The system will support real-time match data, offline capabilities with conflict resolution, and comprehensive content moderation.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript (React Native), Go 1.22+, SQL  
**Primary Dependencies**: React Native with Expo, Gin framework, PostgreSQL, Redis, OpenAI API, Socket.io  
**Storage**: PostgreSQL (primary), Redis (caching), AWS S3 (media), CloudFront (CDN)  
**Testing**: Jest (React Native), Go testing, React Native Testing Library  
**Target Platform**: iOS 15+, Android 8+, AWS cloud infrastructure  
**Project Type**: Mobile + API (React Native app with Go backend)  
**Performance Goals**: <3s app load, <200ms API p95, <1s navigation, 10k concurrent users  
**Constraints**: Offline-capable, <50MB bundle size, <200MB memory usage, real-time updates  
**Scale/Scope**: 10k users initially, 23 functional requirements, 4 user stories, 7 key entities  

**Key Integrations**:
- API-Football for match data (cached aggressively)
- OpenAI GPT-4 for AI debate generation
- AWS Comprehend for content moderation
- NewsAPI for news aggregation
- AWS Cognito for authentication

**Architecture Decisions**:
- Monorepo structure with apps/ (mobile, admin) and services/ (api, workers)
- Real-time updates via WebSockets
- Offline-first with conflict resolution
- AI content guidelines with bias detection
- Manual admin verification for team managers

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

**Code Quality Standards:**

- [x] TypeScript strict mode compliance verified (existing mobile app uses TypeScript)
- [x] ESLint configuration defined with zero warnings (existing setup in mobile app)
- [x] Function complexity ≤ 10, length ≤ 50 lines (will be enforced in development)
- [x] Meaningful naming conventions established (following existing patterns)

**Testing Standards:**

- [x] TDD approach planned for new features (Jest + React Native Testing Library)
- [x] Unit test coverage target ≥ 80% identified (business logic and components)
- [x] Integration test requirements defined (API endpoints, database interactions)
- [x] E2E test scenarios for P1 user stories planned (match following, debate engagement)

**User Experience Consistency:**

- [x] Design system compliance verified (React Native components with consistent styling)
- [x] Accessibility requirements (WCAG 2.1 AA) identified (mobile accessibility standards)
- [x] Loading states and error handling planned (async operations, network failures)
- [x] Responsive design considerations documented (iOS/Android responsive layouts)

**Performance Requirements:**

- [x] Performance benchmarks defined (<3s load, <200ms API, <1s navigation)
- [x] Bundle size impact assessed (<50MB mobile app target)
- [x] Database query performance targets set (<100ms p95 for queries)
- [x] Caching strategy planned (Redis for match data, offline storage)

**Developer Experience:**

- [x] Documentation requirements identified (API docs, setup guides)
- [x] API documentation needs defined (OpenAPI/Swagger for Go backend)
- [x] Development environment setup documented (existing monorepo structure)
- [x] Code review guidelines established (existing GitHub workflow)

**Structure Decision**: Mobile + API monorepo structure with existing React Native mobile app and Go backend services. The structure supports the three main components: mobile app for users, API service for backend logic, and admin dashboard for management. Shared packages provide common functionality across applications.
