# Tasks: Football Community Platform

**Feature**: Football Community Platform  
**Branch**: `001-football-community`  
**Date**: 2025-01-23  
**Generated from**: spec.md, data-model.md, contracts/api.yaml, plan.md

## Summary

This task list implements a global fan and grassroots football community platform combining live match insights, AI-powered debates, and media-driven engagement. The platform serves as a mobile application for football fans and community teams, merging real-time match engagement with social and interactive features.

**Total Tasks**: 67  
**User Stories**: 4 (P1-P4)  
**MVP Scope**: User Story 1 (Live Match Following) - 18 tasks  
**Full Implementation**: All 4 user stories - 67 tasks

## Dependencies

**Story Completion Order**:

1. **Phase 1-2**: Setup & Foundational (blocking prerequisites)
2. **Phase 3**: User Story 1 - Live Match Following (P1) - **MVP**
3. **Phase 4**: User Story 2 - AI-Powered Debate Engagement (P2)
4. **Phase 5**: User Story 3 - Community Team Management (P3)
5. **Phase 6**: User Story 4 - Media-Driven Engagement (P4)
6. **Phase 7**: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Parallel Opportunities**: Each user story can be developed independently once foundational tasks are complete. Within each story, models, services, and endpoints can be developed in parallel.

## Implementation Strategy

**MVP First**: Focus on User Story 1 (Live Match Following) to deliver core value proposition quickly. This provides the foundation for all other features.

**Incremental Delivery**: Each user story is independently testable and deployable, enabling continuous value delivery.

**Independent Test Criteria**:

- **US1**: Can follow a single match from start to finish with live updates
- **US2**: Can view and participate in AI-generated debates for completed matches
- **US3**: Can create and manage a complete team profile with players
- **US4**: Can browse and share match stories and team content
