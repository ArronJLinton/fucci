## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Live Match Following (Priority: P1)

Football fans can follow live professional and community matches with real-time updates, scores, and match insights.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - users need to track matches to engage with the platform. Without live match data, the debate and community features have no foundation.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by following a single match from start to finish, receiving live updates, and viewing match statistics without any other features.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user opens the app, **When** they browse available matches, **Then** they see a list of live and upcoming professional and community matches
2. **Given** a user selects a match, **When** they view match details, **Then** they see live score, time, teams, and basic match information
3. **Given** a match is in progress, **When** the user refreshes the match view, **Then** they receive updated scores and match events
4. **Given** a user follows a match, **When** they navigate away and return, **Then** they can quickly access their followed matches

### User Story 2 - AI-Powered Debate Engagement (Priority: P2)

Users can participate in AI-generated debates about matches, players, and teams, with intelligent prompts that encourage discussion and learning.

**Why this priority**: This differentiates the platform from basic match tracking apps by providing unique AI-driven social engagement that keeps users active beyond just viewing scores.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by viewing AI-generated debate topics for a completed match and participating in discussions without needing to follow live matches.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a match has concluded, **When** a user views the match details, **Then** they see AI-generated debate topics related to the match
2. **Given** a user sees a debate topic, **When** they tap to participate, **Then** they can read the topic, view existing responses, and add their own opinion
3. **Given** a user participates in a debate, **When** they submit their response, **Then** their contribution is visible to other users
4. **Given** a user engages with debates, **When** they return to the app, **Then** they see their debate history and can continue discussions

### User Story 3 - Community Team Management (Priority: P3)

Community team managers can create and manage digital profiles for their teams, players, and content to build their local football community presence.

**Why this priority**: This enables grassroots football engagement and community building, expanding the platform beyond professional football to local teams and leagues.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by a team manager creating a team profile, adding players, and managing team information without needing live match data or debates.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a team manager wants to create a team profile, **When** they access the team management section, **Then** they can create a new team with basic information
2. **Given** a team profile exists, **When** the manager adds player information, **Then** they can create player profiles with stats and photos
3. **Given** a team has matches scheduled, **When** the manager updates match information, **Then** the team's followers receive notifications
4. **Given** a team manager wants to engage their community, **When** they post team updates, **Then** their followers can see and interact with the content

---

### User Story 4 - Media-Driven Engagement (Priority: P4)

Users can view and share dynamic match stories, news, and lineups in a social media-style format that encourages community interaction.

**Why this priority**: This provides the social and visual engagement layer that makes the platform sticky and encourages user retention through content consumption and sharing.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by browsing match stories, viewing team lineups, and sharing content without participating in debates or managing teams.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user opens the app, **When** they browse the news feed, **Then** they see dynamic stories about matches, teams, and players
2. **Given** a user views a match story, **When** they want to share it, **Then** they can share the story with other users or external platforms
3. **Given** a user is interested in a team, **When** they view team details, **Then** they see current lineups, recent news, and team statistics
4. **Given** a user follows multiple teams, **When** they check their personalized feed, **Then** they see relevant stories and updates from their followed teams
