## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - View News Feed (Priority: P0)

Football fans can view recent and historic football news on the home screen to stay informed about the latest happenings in world football.

**Why this priority**: This is the core feature - users need to see news content to engage with the platform. This establishes Fucci as a comprehensive football fan platform beyond just match tracking.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by opening the home screen, viewing the news feed, and interacting with articles without any other features.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user opens the app, **When** they view the home screen, **Then** they see a news feed with up to 10 recent football articles
2. **Given** a user sees the news feed, **When** they view an article card, **Then** they see the headline, snippet, source, publication time, and thumbnail (if available)
3. **Given** a user taps a news article, **When** they open the article, **Then** it opens in an in-app web view (react-native-webview)
4. **Given** a user wants fresh content, **When** they pull to refresh, **Then** the feed updates with the latest articles
5. **Given** the API is unavailable, **When** the user views the feed, **Then** they see cached articles (if cached content exists, no visual indicator shown to user) OR an error message with retry button (if no cached content available)
