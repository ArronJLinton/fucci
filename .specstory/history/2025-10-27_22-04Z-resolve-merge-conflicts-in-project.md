The user is asking to "accept all current changes" which in the context of merge conflicts means to accept all changes from HEAD (the current branch). Looking at the conflicts shown in the manually added selections, there are conflicts in multiple files.

Let me analyze what I need to do:
1. For `.gitignore` - I can see there's a conflict at line 3 with `apps/mobile/node_modules/`. I need to accept the current HEAD version (before the conflict markers).
2. For the other files, I need to accept the HEAD versions.

Actually, looking at the .gitignore file I just read, it doesn't have conflict markers anymore - it looks already resolved with `apps/mobile/node_modules/` at line 3.

Let me check the files that still have conflicts. Looking at the manually added selections, I see conflicts in:
- `.gitignore` - but the current file I read shows no conflict markers
- `.specstory/history/2025-10-22_18-49Z-setup-workspaces-for-project.md` - a large file with many conflicts
- `apps/mobile/.babelrc` - has conflicts
- `apps/mobile/App.tsx` - has conflicts
- `apps/mobile/README.md` - has conflicts
- `apps/mobile/app.json` - has conflicts
- `apps/mobile/package.json` - has conflicts
- `yarn.lock` - has conflicts

Let me read these files to see their current state.
