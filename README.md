Shared React Native components and styles.

## Infrastructure

### Terraform (`infra/terraform/`)

Infrastructure as Code for AWS:

- VPC and networking
- RDS PostgreSQL database
- S3 for media storage

## Development Workflow

1. **Code Quality**: Pre-commit hooks ensure code quality
2. **Testing**: Comprehensive test suites for all services
3. **Linting**: ESLint for TypeScript/JavaScript, golangci-lint for Go
4. **Type Safety**: TypeScript throughout the frontend
5. **API-First**: OpenAPI specification drives client generation
